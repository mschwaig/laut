# all this input resolution stuff is pretty half-baked
# maybe this should be the big typed thing that return from
# recursing through the build-time closure
# so it woudl have a couple of things
#class InputResolution:
# some way to understand what a specific unresovled derivation resolves to
# but we also may need to tie this intermediary result to a specific 'part'
# of the trust model somehow
# grouping resolved derivations in key-specific subsets could work
# for not counting keys twice, which produced two different resolutions
#    {{resolved_drv1, reolved_drv2}, {resolved_drv3}}
# while if we want to support constructing trust models via nesting,
# which might make sense and would be very elegant, because we can build a lot
# up that way starting from the threshold function that is kind of outlined
# in the comments that are part of the VM tests
# we could address those subgroups using hashes of the set of keys they countain, merkle-style
# sadly that does not necessarily give good answers about what should come out of the lookup
# for subgroups ... the set of keys? or the set of resolved derivations?
# set of keys seems to make sense, but not sure
# this needs more thought
#    (subgroup_key) -> list [subgroup_key | resolved_drv]
